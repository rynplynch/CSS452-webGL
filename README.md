# What is this repo?

This repository outlines my journey as I move through the U.W. Bothell css452 course.

All of the work done here follows the course repository found [here](https://github.com/Apress/build-your-own-2d-game-engine-2e/tree/main)

My commits will be the incremental updates I make to my game engine as I follow along in the textbook.
