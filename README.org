#+title: CSS452: 2D Game Engine Course


* What is this repo?
This repository outlines my journey as I move through the U.W. Bothell css452 course.

All of the work done here follows the course repository found [[https://github.com/Apress/build-your-own-2d-game-engine-2e/tree/main][here]]

My commits will be the incremental updates I make to my game engine as I follow along in the textbook.

* Running
To run, navigate to any of the mp<number> folders are run using the live-server command
ex.
#+begin_src bash
live-server --open=index.html
#+end_src

mp1 will be a more basic implementation as appose to mp2
